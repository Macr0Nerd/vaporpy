# VaporPy
*Your computer will hate me*

## About
VaporPy happened because I was vibing to some vaporwave music at 4 AM while sleep-deprived.
So, I had the wonderful idea to use the data in an audio file to create some kind of graphic.
However, I wasn't sure what kind of graphic, so I decided to just start with a color shift.
And it works!

kinda.

See, the logic all works and the algorithm does what it's supposed to, but there's simply too much data in a wave file.
After about 2500 data points, my computer says no thank you and kills the process.
And due to the nature of the algorithm, it's inherently synchronous so multiprocessing doesn't really work.
So play around with it and do whatever.
Don't blame me if you brick your computer.
